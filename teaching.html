        <p>CS 61B Teaching Assistant</p>
            <ul>
                <li> I have been on the content team since Spring 2023 and in charge of Regular Discussion materials since Spring 2024. In Spring 2025, I became Content Lead. </li>
                <li> I am overseeing a Typst pilot of 61B discussion materials, with the goal of easing onboarding and maintenance for future Content staff. I am also developing new discussions + accompanying resources alongside the professors.</li>
                <li> In Spring 2024, I made major revisions to Regular Discussion 09, including new graphs and a new problem. You

                <li> I created the Final Review Kahoot that has been in use for a year as of August 2024. You can find it <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/share/cs61b-final-kahoot/37dfa0dd-7c95-458a-b529-f4d471cc7dab">here (deprecated)</a> and <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/share/cs61b-final-kahoot/17fd1a78-8741-4916-97a4-e5359b22bfef">here (current version)</a>.
                If you would like to see new trivia questions, please suggest them to me.</li>
                <li> I reformatted existing LaTeX worksheets and solutions to make them cleaner for future revisions and easier to navigate for students.
                    In addition, I converted many existing diagrams to LaTeX.</li>
                <li> I am also responsible for many other modifications of regular discussion-related resources. Occasionally I record walkthrough videos and edit the course textbook.</li>
